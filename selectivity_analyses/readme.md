This folder contains MATLAB and python scripts used for model representation
analysis.

Contents:  
`selectivity_analysis_final.m`  : runs all selectivity analyses  
`temporal_analysis_final.m`     : runs all segmentation analyses  
`result_plots_selectivity.m`    : plotting for the selectivity  
`result_plots_segmentation.m`   : plotting for the segmentation  
`activations_unified.py`        : the main script to extract activations of each model in Keras/TensorFlow  
`extract_all_activations.m`     : calls activations_unified.py for all conditions  

`measures/`                     : contains scripts for the selectivity metrics  
`aux/`                          : contains auxiliary scripts used in the code  

Note: model referred to as "CNN17" in the code corresponds to "CNN0" in the paper.
